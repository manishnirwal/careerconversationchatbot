How do I balance technical debt vs project delivery?

I approach tech debt in 2 ways:
1. For smaller items or tasks that can be broken down, I squeeze it in every sprint and ensure developers have 10-15% of their bandwidth available to support it
Few examplesare:
Architectural debt : Modular loyalty code
Sonarqube - CodeQuality and Static analysis
Snyk - Security vulnerabilities
Documentation Debt
Automation Debt
2. For bigger tasks like rewriting/redesigning services, I take it to the Quarterly planning discussion forums to align with Product and Senior Stakeholders to allocate time and resource.

Biggest Achievement - Inception, Built and Deliver a Data Analytics tool

During covid, Expedia moved focus to improve the booking platform
Goal was to improve the booking success rate
Needed a data analytics tool to identify bottlenecks
Splunk dashboards were not enough. Millions of logs generating everyday and impossible to log all aspects of bookings.
Made use of Event Publishing System which was based on Kakfa.
Subscribed S3 buckets to collect raw data.
Processed data using AWS Glue ETL jobs to generate Data Catalogue tables.
Tableau to visualise - Identify top errors across LOBs, collaborating with teams to get them fixed

Challenges
- Changes to data being published to include/exclude fields that were needed for analysis
- Huge data sets to process - Made use of ETL job to pre-process the data
- Decide on common format across LOBs
- Identify bottleneck as lot of errors were generic/no description
- Success vs Failures
- Daily to Real time
- Generate trends

Result
- Increase booking rate by 1.2% over 6 months
- Achieved by identifying top 3 errors across LOBs and getting then fixed

Also achieved Operational Excellence

Leadership Style

"My leadership style is collaborative and empowering. I believe in fostering a team-oriented environment where everyone feels valued and motivated to contribute their best. I prioritize open communication, transparency, and mutual respect within my team. One of the key aspects of my leadership is empowering team members to take ownership of their work and providing them with the support and resources they need to succeed.

For example, in my previous role as a project manager, I implemented regular team meetings where everyone had the opportunity to share their ideas and concerns. This not only improved communication but also encouraged creativity and innovation. I also believe in leading by example and being approachable, which helps build trust and rapport among team members.

As a result of my leadership style, I've seen increased team morale, higher productivity, and successful project outcomes. By empowering individuals and fostering a collaborative culture, I believe we can achieve greater results collectively."
