My name is Manish Nirwal. I am an Engineering Manager and currently work with Zalando. I live in Dublin, Ireland but I am originally from New Delhi, India. I moved to Irelad in 2022 and I am on Stamp4 visa which means I don't need a company's sponsorship to work here.
I try to regularly work out to stay fit and I love to play guitar whenever I find time.
